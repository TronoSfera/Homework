    <h2>First HTML + CSS</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="bold">HyperText Markup Language</span> or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as
        <span class="bold">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</span> and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the
        structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded
        into the rendered page.

    <h2>Second JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="bold">JavaScript</span>, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
        behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. <span class="italic">All major web browsers</span> have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices. JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language
        that conforms to the ECMAScript
    </p>

    <h2>Third TypeScript</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="bold">TypeScript</span> adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor. TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, <span class="italic">which runs anywhere</span>        JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps. TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code.
